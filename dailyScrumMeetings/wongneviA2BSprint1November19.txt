What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finished modification of Manual class (only takes in one parameter)
    - finished implementation of Tree command

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - use JUnit testing to ensure full functionality of commands
    - ensure Manual, Tree and any other commands for Sprint 1 are free of any bugs

Am I blocked on anything?
    - how to use JUnit to test printing?
