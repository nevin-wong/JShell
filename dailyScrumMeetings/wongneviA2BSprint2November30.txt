What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Ensured entire project is Javadocumented
    - Thorough JUnit testing for JShell, Interpreter, Man, Tree, Pushd, File, Directory
    - Incorporated Iterator design into CommandHistory and also directory
    - Ensured this JShell is fully functional as per the customer's specifications

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Nothing for A2b because I literally can't! 
    - But probably study for the B07 quiz work, complete the mock quiz and work on tasks from other courses

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Hope not!
