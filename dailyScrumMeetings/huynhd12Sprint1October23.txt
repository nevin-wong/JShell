What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Added exit class and code for exit class
    - Added 'exit' keyword to be recognized by interpreter
    - Made interpreter call the exit function allowing the shell to exit
    - Added ability to print messages to shell through interpreter calls

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Will probably need to split up some work with other members because i'm done my sprint work
    -

Am I blocked on anything?
    - nothing, but lacking things to do so will probably split up work with other members
