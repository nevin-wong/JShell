What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finished the code for PopDirOntoStack command
    - worked on Javadocumenting all the classes

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - make sure all possible errors are accounted for
    - make sure all error messages are accurate and appropriate
    - help out the others with testing and writing of code if they need
    - Javadocument some more parts of the project

Am I blocked on anything?
    - how to test the most efficiently, are there any test cases we're missing
