What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finished remove class
	- modified path class to work better if path just the root directory

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- modifying classes to return a string rather than printing for testing
	- move and copy
    - using JUnit on remove
	- JUnit on move and copy if time permits
Am I blocked on anything?
    - nothing
