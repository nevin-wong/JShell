What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Modified the Interpreter to implement redirection
    - Interpreter checks whether the command produces StdOut before making the new file
    - New method for all commands to determine whether or not it produces StdOut

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Make sure project is being thoroughly Javadocumented
    - Very thorough JUnit testing for JShell, Interpreter, Man, Tree, Pushd, StorageUnit, File, Directory, and more if needed
    - Probably incorporate Iterator Design Pattern to the ArrayList of history
    - Commit the final sprint daily after developing and testing that this JShell is fully functional as per the customer's specifications

Am I blocked on anything?
    - how to use Mock Objects the most efficiently and effectively
