a) What did I work on in the last three days?
    - wrote down basic algorithm for ConcatenateFile methods
    - created base code for hasForbidChar() in StorageUnit
    - wrote down basic algorithm for hasForbidChar()

b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - work on ConcatenateFile methods
    - complete hasForbidChar() in StorageUnit

c) Am I blocked on anything?
    - checking for any forbidden characters in a string without using an if statement to check for each forbidden character
      - since this would exceed the 100 character per line convention
      - and if i separate it into multiple if statements, it will be not as readable
