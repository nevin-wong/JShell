What did I work on in the last three days?
    - made the majority of JShell methods needed for this Sprint
    - made base code for Interpreter class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish majority of Interpreter class
    - have Interpreter parse the user commands JShell passes to it into individual words
    - have Interpreter interpret the first word of the user input and pass it to the appropriate subclass of ShellCommand
    - start base code for ShellCommand class which all other command classes will inherit

Am I blocked on anything?
    - what will all command classes be in common (methods, private variables, etc) that will be in the ShellCommand class?
