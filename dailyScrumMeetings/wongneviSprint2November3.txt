What did I work on in the last three days?
    - allowed Manual class to take in multiple parameters for multiple command manuals using a for loop
    - finished writing getManual methods for all commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - somehow incorporate a HashMap so Interpreter and Manual won't have to use a slew of if and else statements to call commands
    - after seeing Lab7, I was reminded that it was possible to make a static private variable, might switch getManual methods to just getManual strings
    - finished PrintError class, inserted error messages in every class
    - write the final sprint backlog for A2a

Am I blocked on anything?
    - are we correct to make all the methods of ShellCommands static, as commands are not necessarily objects, but tools
