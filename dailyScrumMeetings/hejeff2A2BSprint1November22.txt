What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finished mv class for some cases
	- redid code in path, ls and remove to make code shorter, more robust and to make testing easier

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- mv for all cases
	- copy 
	- lots of JUnit testing
Am I blocked on anything?
    - is removing a StorageUnit from the directorys arraylist sufficient for removing it from memory?
