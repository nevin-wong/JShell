What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Created JUnit test files for Manual and Tree
    - Created new StdOut class for easy redirection and also testing
    - Implemented the use of StdOut to all classes
    - Wrote manuals for the new commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Have the Interpreter interpret when the user wants to overwrite and append to a file and call the commands accordingly
    - Make sure project is being thoroughly Javadocumented

Am I blocked on anything?
    - how to incorporate Iterator design pattern, also better to do it earlier in case stuff needs re-factoring
